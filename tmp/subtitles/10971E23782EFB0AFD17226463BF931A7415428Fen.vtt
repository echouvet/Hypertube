2
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:37.369
You're from Baker?

3
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.591
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

4
00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:54.888
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

5
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:57.849
I know nothing about that case of coins.

6
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:03.313
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

7
00:11:03.438 --> 00:11:06.983
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

8
00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.361
They couldn't uncover any more.

9
00:11:09.486 --> 00:11:12.280
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

10
00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:15.825
Go back and tell him that.

11
00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:20.622
Word's around you had a visitor.

12
00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:23.333
And Baker knows it.

13
00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:27.295
Name of Jackson.

14
00:11:30.007 --> 00:11:31.467
Well?

15
00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:34.095
Jackson was here.

16
00:11:35.513 --> 00:11:38.683
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

17
00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.733
He's not wrong.

18
00:11:47.858 --> 00:11:52.613
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

19
00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:55.783
about the cash box.

20
00:11:58.578 --> 00:12:01.706
That's not what I'm being paid for.

21
00:12:05.252 --> 00:12:09.840
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

22
00:12:12.342 --> 00:12:15.262
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

23
00:12:15.304 --> 00:12:18.307
I would have found him already.

24
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.727
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

25
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.855
That's why they pay me.

26
00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:31.528
What is Baker paying you?

27
00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:37.993
That your family?

28
00:12:46.127 --> 00:12:47.670
Yes.

29
00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:51.341
Nice family.

30
00:12:52.592 --> 00:12:55.595
What does he pay you for murdering me?

31
00:12:58.097 --> 00:13:02.393
500 dollars, to get the name.

32
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.610
The name.

33
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.289
Carson... Bill Carson.

34
00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:25.960
That's what he calls himself now.

35
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.910
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

36
00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:05.250
A thousand dollars?

37
00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:11.339
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

38
00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:17.345
But when I'm paid...

39
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.515
I always see the job through.

40
00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:35.676
It's you. Any information?

41
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.681
Too much.

42
00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:43.685
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

43
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.521
And one or two things that interested me.

44
00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:48.690
Such as?

45
00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:52.777
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

46
00:15:55.697 --> 00:15:58.616
That's your bit.

47
00:15:59.867 --> 00:16:01.953
Keep talking.

48
00:16:02.036 --> 00:16:05.915
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

49
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.043
which just happened to disappear.

50
00:16:09.085 --> 00:16:11.045
That's my bit.

51
00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:13.214
Anything else?

52
00:16:13.298 --> 00:16:15.508
Not enough for you, eh?

53
00:16:15.633 --> 00:16:19.680
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

54
00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:22.474
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

55
00:16:23.225 --> 00:16:25.811
Here... Here you are.

56
00:16:25.936 --> 00:16:29.398
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

57
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:31.900
Worth 500 dollars.

58
00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:37.406
Yeah. I almost forgot.

59
00:16:37.489 --> 00:16:39.992
He gave me a thousand.

60
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:43.245
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

61
00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:55.258
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

62
00:16:55.342 --> 00:16:57.093
You know that.

63
00:16:57.218 --> 00:16:59.930
No! Angel Eyes!

64
00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.227
No. No pistol, amigo.

65
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.523
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

66
00:18:04.662 --> 00:18:06.330
Hey, amigo...

67
00:18:06.455 --> 00:18:11.670
You know you got a face beautiful enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

68
00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:16.592
Yeah...

69
00:18:16.675 --> 00:18:20.846
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

70
00:18:27.311 --> 00:18:30.022
A couple of steps back.

71
00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:25.788
Thank you.

72
00:19:34.672 --> 00:19:36.966
How much are you worth now?

73
00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:39.051
How much?

74
00:19:39.468 --> 00:19:41.971
2,000 dollars.

75
00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:46.141
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

76
00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:48.936
2,000 dollars.

77
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.241
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

78
00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:04.369
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

79
00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:09.291
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

80
00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:12.419
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

81
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.796
Cut me loose!

82
00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:20.885
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

83
00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.054
Let me go.

84
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:27.851
I feel sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

85
00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:32.857
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

86
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.156
You swine!

87
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.701
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

88
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:47.330
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

89
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.166
Come back and fight.

90
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.168
You bastard.

91
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:56.923
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

92
00:20:57.048 --> 00:21:00.801
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

93
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:03.095
I'm innocent of everything.

94
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.933
So you're an honest farmer?

95
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.561
You recognise this man?

96
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.606
Yeah, it's you.

97
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.652
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

98
00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:21.031
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

99
00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:24.660
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

100
00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:28.121
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

101
00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:33.669
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

102
00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:37.839
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

103
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:39.758
You know who you are?

104
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.219
Want to know whose son you are?

105
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.764
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

106
00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:48.351
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

107
00:21:48.476 --> 00:21:51.271
And your mother, she's...

108
00:21:51.396 --> 00:21:53.731
You bastard!

109
00:21:53.773 --> 00:21:58.486
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

110
00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:04.617
Wanted in 14 counties of this state,
the condemned is found guilty

111
00:22:04.742 --> 00:22:11.833
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery
of citizens, state banks and post offices,

112
00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:15.753
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

113
00:22:15.878 --> 00:22:20.676
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

114
00:22:20.759 --> 00:22:23.262
inciting prostitution, kidnapping,

115
00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:27.891
extortion, receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

116
00:22:27.975 --> 00:22:32.980
passing counterfeit money, and,
contrary to the laws of this state,

117
00:22:33.105 --> 00:22:37.568
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards...

118
00:22:37.651 --> 00:22:41.739
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

119
00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:44.825
we sentence the accused here before us,

120
00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:48.704
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan-Maria Ramirez...

121
00:22:48.829 --> 00:22:51.874
Known as "The Rat".

122
00:22:53.626 --> 00:22:55.711
.. to hang by the neck until dead.

123
00:22:55.794 --> 00:22:59.382
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

124
00:23:25.408 --> 00:23:27.410
Five for you.

125
00:23:27.494 --> 00:23:31.665
One, two, three, four... five for me.

126
00:23:33.668 --> 00:23:38.256
Five for you and five for me.

127
00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:40.675
Know how much you're worth now?

128
00:23:40.758 --> 00:23:44.178
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

129
00:23:48.057 --> 00:23:50.977
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

130
00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:55.564
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

131
00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:00.569
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

132
00:24:00.611 --> 00:24:04.323
So the next time I want more than half.

133
00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:09.037
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

134
00:24:10.038 --> 00:24:14.334
If we cut down my percentage...

135
00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:16.628
Cigar?

136
00:24:17.671 --> 00:24:20.048
.. liable to interfere with my aim.

137
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:26.221
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

138
00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:30.392
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

139
00:24:30.434 --> 00:24:34.354
he understands nothing about Tuco.

140
00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:36.565
Nothing.

141
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:41.862
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

142
00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:45.617
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

143
00:24:45.742 --> 00:24:49.162
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

144
00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:53.291
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

145
00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:58.338
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

146
00:24:58.421 --> 00:25:01.758
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

147
00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:04.093
derailing a train...

148
00:25:04.093 --> 00:25:06.262
Hey, Angel Eyes.

149
00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:15.772
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

150
00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:20.026
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

151
00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:25.032
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

152
00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:27.618
What wasn't saved was the coins.

153
00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:31.705
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

154
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:34.625
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

155
00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:38.879
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

156
00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:43.801
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

157
00:25:45.135 --> 00:25:46.637
Where is Carson?

158
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.974
All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

159
00:25:50.057 --> 00:25:54.311
He lives with a girl called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

160
00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:57.649
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

161
00:25:57.774 --> 00:25:59.567
Someplace fairly near.

162
00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:03.405
Santa Ana.

163
00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:09.661
Adios, half-soldier.

164
00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:15.292
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

165
00:26:15.417 --> 00:26:17.586
.. and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

166
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:20.839
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

167
00:26:20.922 --> 00:26:23.091
and, after receiving payment in advance,

168
00:26:23.216 --> 00:26:26.678
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

169
00:26:26.761 --> 00:26:30.599
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

170
00:26:30.724 --> 00:26:35.187
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

171
00:26:36.355 --> 00:26:39.358
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

172
00:26:46.365 --> 00:26:50.286
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

173
00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:54.206
For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

174
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.835
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

175
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.755
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

176
00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:19.399
Let's get the hell out of here!

177
00:27:49.847 --> 00:27:52.767
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

178
00:27:52.892 --> 00:27:54.852
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

179
00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:58.314
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

180
00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:03.736
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

181
00:28:05.613 --> 00:28:07.782
Yeah. You're right.

182
00:28:07.907 --> 00:28:10.618
It's getting tougher.

183
00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:17.292
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

184
00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:18.626
What do you mean?

185
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:22.631
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

186
00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:25.634
What do you mean?

187
00:28:25.718 --> 00:28:28.554
I mean our partnership is untied.

188
00:28:29.722 --> 00:28:31.682
Oh, no, not you.

189
00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:33.559
You remain tied.

190
00:28:33.642 --> 00:28:36.645
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

191
00:28:36.687 --> 00:28:40.858
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

192
00:28:40.983 --> 00:28:43.986
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

193
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:48.240
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

194
00:28:48.907 --> 00:28:50.034
Adios.

195
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:53.370
You filthy bastard! Come here!

196
00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:58.793
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

197
00:28:58.918 --> 00:29:02.130
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

198
00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:07.260
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

199
00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:09.846
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

200
00:29:11.932 --> 00:29:16.311
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

201
00:29:21.107 --> 00:29:24.069
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

202
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.030
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

203
00:29:27.155 --> 00:29:30.909
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

204
00:29:55.101 --> 00:29:58.312
I believe madam is home.

205
00:29:58.437 --> 00:30:00.523
Sweet dreams.

206
00:30:11.368 --> 00:30:14.079
You filthy rats!

207
00:30:29.595 --> 00:30:32.014
Maria?

208
00:30:38.186 --> 00:30:41.189
Is that you, Bill?

209
00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:43.191
Bill!

210
00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:46.194
Arh!

211
00:30:52.368 --> 00:30:54.203
Who are you?

212
00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:56.289
What do you want with me?

213
00:30:56.414 --> 00:30:59.751
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

214
00:30:59.792 --> 00:31:02.462
I don't know him.

215
00:31:02.545 --> 00:31:05.798
You were calling to him in the dark.

216
00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:10.803
Where is he?

217
00:31:10.887 --> 00:31:13.222
What are you gonna do to him?

218
00:31:14.557 --> 00:31:16.851
I'll ask the questions.

219
00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:21.022
Where is he?

220
00:31:27.821 --> 00:31:29.657
Where is he? Where?

221
00:31:29.782 --> 00:31:32.493
Where? Where?

222
00:31:32.534 --> 00:31:34.787
Where?

223
00:31:37.581 --> 00:31:39.667
That's enough.

224
00:31:40.918 --> 00:31:44.254
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

225
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.716
and went away with his unit. They all left.

226
00:31:47.758 --> 00:31:49.927
Which company? Where did they go?

227
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:53.973
Hm?

228
00:31:54.098 --> 00:31:58.978
3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

229
00:32:00.021 --> 00:32:03.275
That's all I know. I swear.

230
00:33:28.654 --> 00:33:30.739
But... but...

231
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.621
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

232
00:33:37.704 --> 00:33:39.373
Mm-hm.

233
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:19.664
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

234
00:34:23.293 --> 00:34:25.170
Revolvers.

235
00:34:25.254 --> 00:34:29.550
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

236
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:36.932
Here, Remington, Colt,

237
00:34:37.057 --> 00:34:39.852
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

238
00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:44.273
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

239
00:34:44.356 --> 00:34:46.525
another Remington, and this one...

240
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.110
That's enough.

241
00:35:31.404 --> 00:35:33.657
Cartridges.

242
00:35:41.499 --> 00:35:45.753
- You wanna try the pistol, step out back.
- Let's go.

243
00:35:50.883 --> 00:35:52.843
Move, move.

244
00:37:07.754 --> 00:37:09.839
Cartridge.

245
00:37:17.764 --> 00:37:20.850
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

246
00:37:21.935 --> 00:37:24.938
No.

247
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.694
Fifty dollars.

248
00:37:30.778 --> 00:37:35.282
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

249
00:37:37.368 --> 00:37:41.413
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

250
00:37:41.538 --> 00:37:43.624
Here.

251
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.105
Come here.

252
00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:12.821
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

253
00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:18.660
- Heh?
- Mm-hm.

254
00:38:23.248 --> 00:38:28.420
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

255
00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:12.048
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

256
00:39:38.492 --> 00:39:40.577
Potatoes.

257
00:39:41.328 --> 00:39:44.581
You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.

258
00:39:45.499 --> 00:39:47.584
Really poor.

259
00:39:47.668 --> 00:39:51.214
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

260
00:39:53.549 --> 00:39:56.344
The world is divided into two parts:

261
00:39:56.427 --> 00:40:02.517
those who have friends,
and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

262
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.940
You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.

263
00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:13.444
Chico and Ramon, his two brothers,
were my friends too.

264
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.201
But who knows where they are now?

265
00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:24.831
Ah, it's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

266
00:40:24.914 --> 00:40:27.209
I had a good deal for you.

267
00:40:29.378 --> 00:40:33.382
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got 4,000 dollars.

268
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.805
4,000 dollars.
And I know where to find it.

269
00:40:42.224 --> 00:40:47.646
If they would help me catch him,
I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.

270
00:40:48.147 --> 00:40:51.400
1,000 dollars each. Hm?

271
00:41:08.627 --> 00:41:11.755
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

272
00:41:14.549 --> 00:41:17.052
And rich. Like you're going to be.

273
00:41:17.177 --> 00:41:20.096
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

274
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.349
And people talk bullshit.

275
00:41:26.102 --> 00:41:29.481
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

276
00:41:29.564 --> 00:41:32.901
And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.

277
00:41:32.943 --> 00:41:34.986
Vamos.

278
00:41:51.253 --> 00:41:53.339
This morning I heard the whole thing.

279
00:41:53.464 --> 00:41:58.552
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

280
00:41:58.678 --> 00:42:01.389
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

281
00:42:01.472 --> 00:42:04.934
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

282
00:42:05.977 --> 00:42:08.854
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

283
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.318
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

284
00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:16.697
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

285
00:42:16.822 --> 00:42:19.741
And they're going to beat the South.

286
00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:25.038
Look. See that one with the white beard,
General Sibley? He looks dead.

287
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.999
He's finally getting out of our hair.

288
00:42:27.124 --> 00:42:32.045
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

289
00:42:35.757 --> 00:42:38.802
Where's the owner of that horse?

290
00:42:38.927 --> 00:42:42.097
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

291
00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:47.144
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

292
00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:52.358
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

293
00:42:52.442 --> 00:42:55.278
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

294
00:42:55.361 --> 00:42:58.990
You stay quiet, old hen.

295
00:42:59.032 --> 00:43:03.202
Upstairs in room four, senor.

296
00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:10.627
Hear that?

297
00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:19.260
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

298
00:46:32.918 --> 00:46:35.504
Your spurs.

299
00:46:49.685 --> 00:46:52.521
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

300
00:46:52.604 --> 00:46:58.027
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

301
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.280
Take off that pistol belt.

302
00:47:07.704 --> 00:47:09.205
It's empty.

303
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:15.128
Mine isn't.

304
00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:23.887
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

305
00:47:27.223 --> 00:47:29.643
That could be cannon fire.

306
00:47:29.726 --> 00:47:34.230
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

307
00:47:35.774 --> 00:47:39.653
You ever see this before, my friend?

308
00:47:47.662 --> 00:47:51.332
Throw it over the roof beam.

309
00:47:51.916 --> 00:47:53.417
That's it.

310
00:48:05.096 --> 00:48:07.181
Now get on that.

311
00:48:17.066 --> 00:48:18.902
That's right.

312
00:48:18.944 --> 00:48:21.446
Now make sure the rope is tight.

313
00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:24.700
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

314
00:48:31.039 --> 00:48:34.459
Now put the rope around your neck.

315
00:48:40.299 --> 00:48:43.135
That's very good.

316
00:48:43.218 --> 00:48:47.097
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

317
00:48:47.222 --> 00:48:51.476
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

318
00:48:52.311 --> 00:48:56.566
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stool.

319
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.156
Adios.

320
00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:14.268
Welcome, my friend.

321
00:52:14.394 --> 00:52:17.939
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

322
00:52:18.022 --> 00:52:21.484
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

323
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:25.655
And the attractions don't stop there.

324
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.034
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

325
00:52:30.076 --> 00:52:32.121
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

326
00:52:32.204 --> 00:52:34.707
Our government has spared no expense.

327
00:52:34.832 --> 00:52:37.710
As you can see, we are treated very well.

328
00:52:37.751 --> 00:52:41.380
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

329
00:52:41.505 --> 00:52:46.635
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

330
00:52:46.719 --> 00:52:50.973
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

331
00:52:51.098 --> 00:52:54.226
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

332
00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:57.229
And you ask me if I know someone.

333
00:52:57.354 --> 00:53:01.525
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

334
00:53:12.245 --> 00:53:16.416
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the 3rd.

335
00:53:18.209 --> 00:53:22.172
If he's with the 3rd...
They've already left.

336
00:53:22.255 --> 00:53:23.923
For Glorietta.

337
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:28.219
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

338
00:53:28.345 --> 00:53:34.267
And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

339
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:36.853
And what if they were still alive?

340
00:53:39.189 --> 00:53:41.441
Worse.

341
00:53:41.566 --> 00:53:45.196
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

342
00:53:45.321 --> 00:53:51.160
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

343
00:53:51.285 --> 00:53:53.788
Keep it. It's yours.

344
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.565
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

345
00:56:22.691 --> 00:56:25.193
guilty of the following crimes:

346
00:56:25.276 --> 00:56:29.864
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

347
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.132
And Shorty?

348
00:56:50.928 --> 00:56:52.054
No.

349
00:56:53.306 --> 00:56:55.933
No?

350
00:56:56.225 --> 00:56:59.979
.. alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck until dead.

351
00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:03.316
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

352
00:57:09.905 --> 00:57:11.490
Sorry, Shorty.

353
00:57:12.908 --> 00:57:15.661
Move. Come on, let's go.

354
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:43.273
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

355
00:57:43.357 --> 00:57:49.196
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

356
00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:16.432
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

357
00:58:17.475 --> 00:58:19.894
Where are we going?

358
00:58:19.978 --> 00:58:21.437
Where?

359
00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:23.940
Where I'm going, amigo.

360
00:58:24.065 --> 00:58:25.817
Over that way.

361
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.779
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

362
00:58:29.904 --> 00:58:32.490
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

363
00:58:32.573 --> 00:58:35.202
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

364
00:58:35.327 --> 00:58:38.414
Canby's men are coming here.

365
00:58:38.539 --> 00:58:42.501
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

366
00:58:42.584 --> 00:58:45.337
Except you and me.

367
00:58:46.463 --> 00:58:49.800
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

368
00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:55.848
What was it you told me the last time?

369
00:58:57.099 --> 00:59:01.895
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

370
00:59:03.022 --> 00:59:07.526
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

371
00:59:08.777 --> 00:59:12.198
Very slowly, old friend.

372
00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:18.038
After you, please.

373
00:59:18.163 --> 00:59:20.248
Start walking.

374
01:01:15.783 --> 01:01:18.161
Taking a rest?

375
01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:22.999
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

376
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:28.004
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

377
01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.673
That's not too bad.

378
01:01:31.758 --> 01:01:33.092
Come on.

379
01:02:17.097 --> 01:02:18.974
Whoa...

380
01:03:23.623 --> 01:03:26.126
OK, let's eat.

381
01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:29.963
That is, I'll eat.

382
01:03:31.757 --> 01:03:36.053
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

383
01:03:43.977 --> 01:03:46.480
You want some water?

384
01:03:50.233 --> 01:03:51.985
Drink.

385
01:03:58.033 --> 01:04:00.244
Come on.

386
01:04:41.203 --> 01:04:44.540
Well, Blondie... So long.

387
01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:54.278
And so, Blondie...

388
01:05:55.863 --> 01:05:58.366
it's goodbye.

389
01:06:54.256 --> 01:06:56.425
Whoa, whoa...

390
01:07:01.347 --> 01:07:02.932
Easy, easy.

391
01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:05.727
Easy. Attaboy.

392
01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:36.840
Water...

393
01:09:44.222 --> 01:09:49.102
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

394
01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:55.067
What's that you say?

395
01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:58.945
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

396
01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:02.367
My name is Bill Carson now.

397
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:05.244
Surprise attack...

398
01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:09.874
All dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

399
01:10:09.957 --> 01:10:14.545
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

400
01:10:14.587 --> 01:10:19.133
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

401
01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:22.303
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

402
01:10:22.387 --> 01:10:25.223
Baker has nothing.

403
01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:29.060
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

404
01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:33.231
Where? Here?

405
01:10:33.314 --> 01:10:37.403
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

406
01:10:37.486 --> 01:10:39.154
Which cemetery?

407
01:10:39.279 --> 01:10:42.908
The one on Sad Hill.

408
01:10:43.033 --> 01:10:45.244
There's a grave...

409
01:10:45.327 --> 01:10:48.330
Which grave? Have a name?

410
01:10:48.455 --> 01:10:53.252
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

411
01:10:53.335 --> 01:10:56.380
There's... no number.

412
01:10:56.505 --> 01:10:59.049
There's a name.

413
01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:01.593
It's written...

414
01:11:08.058 --> 01:11:10.978
Water...

415
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:14.816
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

416
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:18.069
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

417
01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:24.200
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1,000... 5,000...

418
01:11:27.787 --> 01:11:31.666
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

419
01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:35.587
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

420
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:38.631
Don't die until later, you son of a...

421
01:12:03.741 --> 01:12:06.744
Get away from there.

422
01:12:11.332 --> 01:12:13.542
He's dead.

423
01:12:16.879 --> 01:12:19.256
I'll kill you.

424
01:12:21.258 --> 01:12:25.221
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

425
01:12:25.347 --> 01:12:28.433
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

426
01:12:28.976 --> 01:12:33.271
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

427
01:12:33.355 --> 01:12:36.358
What did he tell you?

428
01:12:36.483 --> 01:12:38.860
A name.

429
01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:43.281
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

430
01:12:56.712 --> 01:12:58.714
Blondie... Don't die.

431
01:12:58.797 --> 01:13:00.882
Blondie, don't die.

432
01:13:00.966 --> 01:13:03.720
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

433
01:13:03.803 --> 01:13:06.305
I'm your friend. Come on.

434
01:13:06.389 --> 01:13:07.974
Come on, eh?

435
01:13:08.057 --> 01:13:11.519
Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.

436
01:13:11.602 --> 01:13:14.647
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

437
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:18.484
Don't die like that pig.

438
01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:20.695
Here's water, Blondie.

439
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.449
Don't drink, it's no good for you.
Feel better?

440
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:28.745
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die.

441
01:13:37.086 --> 01:13:40.466
Hey, open up! Hurry!

442
01:13:40.507 --> 01:13:43.635
Settle down. Who's there?

443
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:49.350
What do you mean, "who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

444
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.522
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

445
01:13:55.606 --> 01:13:56.899
Come on.

446
01:13:56.982 --> 01:14:00.527
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

447
01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:06.450
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

448
01:14:07.826 --> 01:14:11.872
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

449
01:14:11.997 --> 01:14:14.042
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

450
01:14:14.084 --> 01:14:18.963
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and travelling papers.

451
01:14:20.131 --> 01:14:24.094
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

452
01:14:24.219 --> 01:14:27.972
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

453
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.021
Are you reading when this man is dying?

454
01:14:35.146 --> 01:14:38.900
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

455
01:14:38.984 --> 01:14:43.071
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

456
01:14:43.822 --> 01:14:47.325
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

457
01:14:48.702 --> 01:14:51.163
Apache Canyon?

458
01:14:51.205 --> 01:14:53.708
Is a mission San Antonio around here?

459
01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:56.002
18 miles south. Take him there.

460
01:14:56.085 --> 01:14:59.755
The brothers take care of any wounded,
whatever the colour of his uniform.

461
01:14:59.839 --> 01:15:02.883
And keep your eyes open -
the area is full of Yankees.

462
01:15:02.925 --> 01:15:04.552
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

463
01:15:04.593 --> 01:15:06.512
Take care.

464
01:15:25.281 --> 01:15:27.367
Whoa!

465
01:15:30.412 --> 01:15:33.623
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

466
01:15:33.749 --> 01:15:36.251
Let him have yours.

467
01:15:41.173 --> 01:15:45.344
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

468
01:15:45.427 --> 01:15:47.804
He should be back any day now.

469
01:15:47.929 --> 01:15:52.100
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

470
01:15:52.142 --> 01:15:53.977
And may God be praised.

471
01:15:54.061 --> 01:15:59.608
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

472
01:16:01.068 --> 01:16:04.906
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

473
01:16:05.031 --> 01:16:07.116
You're heavy.

474
01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.046
There.

475
01:16:48.826 --> 01:16:51.870
All right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

476
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:55.708
Put him in my cell.

477
01:16:55.749 --> 01:16:57.793
Easy.

478
01:17:00.212 --> 01:17:02.506
Out, soldier. Out you go.

479
01:17:02.589 --> 01:17:06.468
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

480
01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.142
Hey, Father, I...

481
01:17:25.822 --> 01:17:29.617
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

482
01:17:58.481 --> 01:18:01.484
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

483
01:18:01.609 --> 01:18:03.277
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

484
01:18:03.361 --> 01:18:08.616
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

485
01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:10.993
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

486
01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:13.788
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

487
01:18:13.913 --> 01:18:16.540
Thanks be to Jesus.

488
01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:06.592
Blondie?

489
01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:15.351
Hey, Blondie?

490
01:19:33.453 --> 01:19:37.874
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

491
01:19:37.957 --> 01:19:41.795
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

492
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.466
Think if you'd been on your own.

493
01:19:45.549 --> 01:19:50.888
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

494
01:19:50.971 --> 01:19:56.185
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

495
01:19:56.310 --> 01:20:01.940
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

496
01:20:02.566 --> 01:20:04.985
Not even a mother.

497
01:20:05.486 --> 01:20:07.571
No-one?

498
01:20:07.655 --> 01:20:11.116
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

499
01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:14.036
We're all alone in the world.

500
01:20:14.078 --> 01:20:17.165
I have you, you have me.

501
01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:21.419
Only for a little while, I mean.

502
01:20:21.544 --> 01:20:26.758
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

503
01:20:26.883 --> 01:20:30.929
We could have all that money
in our hands.

504
01:20:35.016 --> 01:20:41.481
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

505
01:20:43.108 --> 01:20:46.361
It's all over for you now.

506
01:20:46.444 --> 01:20:50.323
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

507
01:20:51.783 --> 01:20:53.661
Oh, God, forgive me.

508
01:20:53.786 --> 01:20:56.872
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

509
01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:10.052
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

510
01:21:10.136 --> 01:21:13.806
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

511
01:21:13.889 --> 01:21:18.060
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

512
01:21:18.144 --> 01:21:21.689
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

513
01:21:21.814 --> 01:21:24.108
I would tell the name on the grave.

514
01:21:24.233 --> 01:21:28.822
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

515
01:21:28.905 --> 01:21:32.117
But you know how many graves
there are there?

516
01:21:32.242 --> 01:21:38.081
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

517
01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:44.421
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

518
01:21:44.546 --> 01:21:47.049
On... on the grave.

519
01:21:48.508 --> 01:21:52.888
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

520
01:21:52.971 --> 01:21:56.016
I'll always honour your memory.

521
01:21:56.099 --> 01:22:00.395
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

522
01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:04.358
Come closer.

523
01:22:09.155 --> 01:22:11.240
Tell me.

524
01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.119
You dirty...

525
01:22:16.871 --> 01:22:19.374
I'll sleep better...

526
01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:23.961
knowing my good friend is by my side...

527
01:22:24.045 --> 01:22:26.464
to protect me.

528
01:22:35.223 --> 01:22:37.517
"Tuco, water. " Well, here's water.

529
01:22:37.642 --> 01:22:42.231
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

530
01:22:48.362 --> 01:22:51.156
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

531
01:22:51.281 --> 01:22:55.035
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

532
01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.457
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

533
01:23:00.582 --> 01:23:03.585
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

534
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:08.590
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

535
01:23:08.674 --> 01:23:11.176
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

536
01:23:27.861 --> 01:23:30.196
Hey, Pablo?

537
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:39.456
Don't you recognise me?

538
01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:43.501
It's me. Tuco.

539
01:23:43.626 --> 01:23:46.629
Let me embrace you...

540
01:23:48.715 --> 01:23:51.843
I don't know the right thing.

541
01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:02.396
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

542
01:24:04.899 --> 01:24:07.193
Did I do wrong?

543
01:24:07.735 --> 01:24:10.237
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

544
01:24:10.321 --> 01:24:12.490
You have seen me, Tuco.

545
01:24:14.492 --> 01:24:17.411
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

546
01:24:23.042 --> 01:24:25.127
Ah, my uniform.

547
01:24:25.211 --> 01:24:27.296
It's a long story.

548
01:24:27.421 --> 01:24:30.759
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

549
01:24:30.884 --> 01:24:35.555
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

550
01:24:37.224 --> 01:24:40.977
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

551
01:24:41.895 --> 01:24:44.940
Wh... What about our parents?

552
01:24:46.525 --> 01:24:52.322
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

553
01:24:54.199 --> 01:24:57.119
Nine years?

554
01:24:57.244 --> 01:24:59.955
So it's nine years.

555
01:24:59.997 --> 01:25:01.623
Nine years.

556
01:25:02.249 --> 01:25:05.043
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

557
01:25:06.546 --> 01:25:12.051
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

558
01:25:13.636 --> 01:25:16.139
He asked for you to be there.

559
01:25:16.222 --> 01:25:19.225
But there was only me.

560
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:27.400
And you?

561
01:25:27.483 --> 01:25:31.654
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

562
01:25:31.738 --> 01:25:36.576
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

563
01:25:37.994 --> 01:25:39.912
Not one. Lots of them.

564
01:25:39.996 --> 01:25:43.751
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

565
01:25:43.876 --> 01:25:48.255
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

566
01:25:48.339 --> 01:25:51.675
What good would that be?

567
01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:54.511
Just keep on the way you're going.

568
01:25:54.595 --> 01:25:56.972
Go away.

569
01:25:57.097 --> 01:25:59.600
- The Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go.

570
01:25:59.683 --> 01:26:02.519
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

571
01:26:02.644 --> 01:26:07.941
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

572
01:26:07.983 --> 01:26:10.361
You think you're better than I am.

573
01:26:10.444 --> 01:26:15.366
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

574
01:26:15.449 --> 01:26:19.829
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

575
01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:22.207
You talk of our mother and father -

576
01:26:22.332 --> 01:26:25.001
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

577
01:26:25.043 --> 01:26:29.214
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

578
01:26:29.297 --> 01:26:33.385
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

579
01:26:33.468 --> 01:26:39.557
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

580
01:26:56.951 --> 01:26:58.619
Tuco.

581
01:27:09.171 --> 01:27:11.340
Please forgive me, brother.

582
01:27:22.601 --> 01:27:24.562
Haa!

583
01:27:40.454 --> 01:27:44.291
Ah, my belly's full.

584
01:27:44.374 --> 01:27:46.710
Nice guy, my brother.

585
01:27:46.793 --> 01:27:49.296
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

586
01:27:49.379 --> 01:27:53.759
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

587
01:27:53.884 --> 01:27:59.097
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other. "

588
01:27:59.222 --> 01:28:03.060
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too. "

589
01:28:03.143 --> 01:28:07.315
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

590
01:28:08.358 --> 01:28:11.486
My brother, he's crazy about me.

591
01:28:15.073 --> 01:28:20.078
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

592
01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:25.249
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.

593
01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.504
Sure.

594
01:28:29.545 --> 01:28:34.342
Well, after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

595
01:29:24.185 --> 01:29:27.313
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

596
01:29:27.397 --> 01:29:30.650
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

597
01:29:30.734 --> 01:29:33.778
That sure is a long way.

598
01:29:33.862 --> 01:29:37.949
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

599
01:29:38.033 --> 01:29:40.243
- After that...
- Then what?

600
01:29:42.329 --> 01:29:47.125
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

601
01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:53.590
Those men aren't worried
about anything any more, are they?

602
01:29:55.343 --> 01:30:01.599
But since I'm alive and I've noticed
we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,

603
01:30:01.724 --> 01:30:04.935
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

604
01:30:05.061 --> 01:30:09.106
Towards 200,000 dollars.
Is that good enough for you?

605
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.076
Whoa.

606
01:30:28.542 --> 01:30:30.378
Wake up, you.

607
01:30:30.503 --> 01:30:33.965
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

608
01:30:40.389 --> 01:30:44.059
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

609
01:30:44.184 --> 01:30:48.021
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

610
01:30:48.146 --> 01:30:51.483
Hurrah! Down with General Grant!

611
01:30:51.566 --> 01:30:53.443
Hurrah for General...

612
01:30:53.568 --> 01:30:55.195
- What's his name?
- Lee.

613
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.780
.. Lee!

614
01:30:57.197 --> 01:31:02.327
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

615
01:31:02.411 --> 01:31:06.164
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

616
01:31:18.344 --> 01:31:22.432
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

617
01:31:22.515 --> 01:31:26.269
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

618
01:31:26.394 --> 01:31:29.605
Prisoners of war, forward...

619
01:31:30.773 --> 01:31:32.442
march.

620
01:31:32.525 --> 01:31:35.778
Hup, two, three, four...

621
01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:31.586
Left face.

622
01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:38.968
Form a single file. Move.

623
01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:23.180
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

624
01:33:29.311 --> 01:33:32.064
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

625
01:33:32.148 --> 01:33:35.986
- Nathaniel Sullivan.
- Present.

626
01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:39.573
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

627
01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:43.076
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

628
01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.331
Bill Carson.

629
01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:53.503
Bill Carson?

630
01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:56.506
I said Bill Carson.

631
01:33:56.548 --> 01:33:59.343
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

632
01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:06.266
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

633
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:09.270
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

634
01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:10.938
Bill Carson!

635
01:34:11.022 --> 01:34:14.192
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

636
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.369
Please, Carson...

637
01:34:25.453 --> 01:34:27.538
answer "present".

638
01:34:28.873 --> 01:34:31.709
What, are you deaf?

639
01:34:36.589 --> 01:34:39.092
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

640
01:34:41.177 --> 01:34:46.183
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

641
01:34:46.308 --> 01:34:49.395
And sometimes they never get up.

642
01:34:50.145 --> 01:34:51.605
Wallace.

643
01:34:53.148 --> 01:34:54.817
That's enough.

644
01:34:57.736 --> 01:34:58.987
Sergeant.

645
01:35:01.198 --> 01:35:05.369
The captain wants to see you right away.

646
01:35:07.037 --> 01:35:10.582
Be sure these two get good treatment.

647
01:35:19.675 --> 01:35:23.596
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

648
01:35:25.932 --> 01:35:28.018
Yeah.

649
01:35:30.395 --> 01:35:33.940
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

650
01:35:34.024 --> 01:35:38.028
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

651
01:35:38.111 --> 01:35:41.031
No more brutality.

652
01:35:41.114 --> 01:35:44.784
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

653
01:35:44.868 --> 01:35:46.953
I have to have respect.

654
01:35:47.078 --> 01:35:52.083
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

655
01:35:53.335 --> 01:35:55.962
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

656
01:35:56.046 --> 01:35:58.924
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

657
01:35:58.966 --> 01:36:05.639
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

658
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:08.142
That an accusation?

659
01:36:08.225 --> 01:36:13.481
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

660
01:36:13.881 --> 01:36:17.426
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

661
01:36:17.468 --> 01:36:20.638
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

662
01:36:20.763 --> 01:36:23.891
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

663
01:36:23.975 --> 01:36:28.980
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

664
01:36:31.315 --> 01:36:32.858
Yes, sir.

665
01:36:32.984 --> 01:36:35.362
Just as long as you're the commandant.

666
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:38.991
Yes, Sergeant.

667
01:36:41.201 --> 01:36:44.955
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

668
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:51.753
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martial

669
01:36:51.837 --> 01:36:57.759
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

670
01:37:02.055 --> 01:37:04.766
I wish you luck.

671
01:37:38.129 --> 01:37:42.424
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

672
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:46.805
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

673
01:37:56.606 --> 01:38:01.194
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

674
01:38:14.666 --> 01:38:18.712
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

675
01:38:18.837 --> 01:38:24.135
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

676
01:38:24.677 --> 01:38:26.637
Get in.

677
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:37.899
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

678
01:38:39.275 --> 01:38:42.361
There's no formalities here.

679
01:38:52.788 --> 01:38:55.416
It's been a long time.

680
01:38:58.462 --> 01:39:00.631
You're hungry.

681
01:39:00.714 --> 01:39:03.467
Sit down. Eat.

682
01:39:21.902 --> 01:39:25.322
I knew it, I knew it!

683
01:39:25.447 --> 01:39:31.495
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes. "

684
01:39:32.538 --> 01:39:36.000
"I bet he got himself an easy job. "

685
01:39:38.503 --> 01:39:41.422
"And he never forgets a friend. "

686
01:39:41.422 --> 01:39:44.342
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

687
01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.345
Right.

688
01:39:47.428 --> 01:39:50.765
It's good to see old friends again.

689
01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:52.433
Good.

690
01:39:52.433 --> 01:39:55.895
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

691
01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:59.524
And have so much to talk about.

692
01:39:59.649 --> 01:40:02.986
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

693
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.033
You were captured near Fort Craig?

694
01:40:13.289 --> 01:40:19.795
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

695
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:36.645
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

696
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:39.982
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

697
01:40:42.067 --> 01:40:47.949
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

698
01:40:50.619 --> 01:40:53.330
One name is as good as another.

699
01:40:53.455 --> 01:40:56.374
Not wise to use your own name.

700
01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.837
Like you.
I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

701
01:41:00.962 --> 01:41:03.882
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

702
01:41:11.932 --> 01:41:14.935
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

703
01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:21.107
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

704
01:41:32.787 --> 01:41:35.039
So...

705
01:41:35.164 --> 01:41:39.210
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

706
01:41:43.214 --> 01:41:46.551
That fake, too?

707
01:41:46.634 --> 01:41:50.805
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

708
01:41:50.888 --> 01:41:55.726
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

709
01:41:58.229 --> 01:42:00.065
Aarh!

710
01:43:18.604 --> 01:43:22.983
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

711
01:43:27.988 --> 01:43:30.282
What did he tell you about the money?

712
01:43:30.407 --> 01:43:32.993
I don't...

713
01:43:33.077 --> 01:43:35.830
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

714
01:43:54.182 --> 01:43:56.017
More feeling.

715
01:44:14.494 --> 01:44:18.123
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

716
01:44:18.248 --> 01:44:21.293
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

717
01:44:21.293 --> 01:44:24.797
So many of us
have had a session in there.

718
01:44:45.485 --> 01:44:48.905
How's your digestion now?

719
01:44:51.616 --> 01:44:56.913
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

720
01:45:23.315 --> 01:45:26.026
Play that fiddle, you.

721
01:46:09.612 --> 01:46:11.823
I'll talk... I'll talk...

722
01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:24.086
What did he say about the money?

723
01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:27.673
It's bu...

724
01:46:27.756 --> 01:46:31.218
It's buried in a grave.

725
01:46:31.302 --> 01:46:33.053
Where?

726
01:46:33.095 --> 01:46:34.513
Sad Hill...

727
01:46:34.638 --> 01:46:37.141
Sad Hill cemetery.

728
01:46:39.852 --> 01:46:41.812
Which grave?

729
01:46:41.812 --> 01:46:45.816
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

730
01:46:47.443 --> 01:46:49.362
Blondie...

731
01:46:49.446 --> 01:46:54.242
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

732
01:47:10.926 --> 01:47:14.054
The war's over for you.

733
01:47:16.056 --> 01:47:19.184
Put those clothes on.

734
01:47:22.395 --> 01:47:24.064
Why?

735
01:47:24.147 --> 01:47:27.193
We're going for a ride.

736
01:47:27.318 --> 01:47:31.239
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

737
01:47:31.364 --> 01:47:34.492
I know the name of the cemetery now.

738
01:47:34.575 --> 01:47:38.162
And you know the name of the grave.

739
01:47:57.223 --> 01:48:00.351
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

740
01:48:03.772 --> 01:48:05.691
Would you talk?

741
01:48:06.525 --> 01:48:08.277
No. Probably not.

742
01:48:10.028 --> 01:48:12.656
That's what I thought.

743
01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:15.033
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

744
01:48:15.159 --> 01:48:18.495
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

745
01:48:22.249 --> 01:48:25.460
And Tuco? Is he...

746
01:48:27.546 --> 01:48:30.674
No. Not yet.

747
01:48:30.716 --> 01:48:33.302
But he's in very good hands.

748
01:48:34.052 --> 01:48:37.556
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deal.

749
01:48:37.598 --> 01:48:40.185
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

750
01:48:41.561 --> 01:48:45.398
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

751
01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.405
Yeah.

752
01:49:11.674 --> 01:49:13.134
Hold it.

753
01:49:13.259 --> 01:49:15.930
That's it. Don't move.

754
01:49:16.055 --> 01:49:21.602
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

755
01:49:21.685 --> 01:49:25.022
Got it. Thank you.

756
01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.374
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

757
01:49:43.457 --> 01:49:47.044
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

758
01:49:47.127 --> 01:49:52.217
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

759
01:49:52.342 --> 01:49:56.096
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

760
01:50:01.226 --> 01:50:02.978
I told you once, friend.

761
01:50:03.061 --> 01:50:07.899
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

762
01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:30.089
You're a lot luckier than that one.

763
01:50:30.173 --> 01:50:32.675
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

764
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.679
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

765
01:52:17.783 --> 01:52:22.788
If your friends stay out in the damp,
they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?

766
01:52:22.913 --> 01:52:25.291
Or a bullet.

767
01:52:29.378 --> 01:52:32.715
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

768
01:52:43.976 --> 01:52:48.898
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

769
01:52:48.981 --> 01:52:51.485
One, two,

770
01:52:51.568 --> 01:52:53.570
three, four,

771
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:56.490
five, six.

772
01:52:56.907 --> 01:53:00.160
Six... Perfect number.

773
01:53:01.411 --> 01:53:04.331
Isn't three the perfect number?

774
01:53:05.457 --> 01:53:09.920
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

775
01:54:12.317 --> 01:54:16.989
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

776
01:54:17.072 --> 01:54:21.785
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

777
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:24.705
You smell like a pig already.

778
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.624
Let's try not to make things any worse.

779
01:54:29.918 --> 01:54:32.004
Get going.

780
01:54:40.263 --> 01:54:43.892
I can't while you're watching me.

781
01:54:54.861 --> 01:54:56.821
Aaaarh!

782
01:55:06.289 --> 01:55:10.043
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

783
01:55:30.397 --> 01:55:34.360
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

784
01:57:18.509 --> 01:57:21.345
Squad, halt.

785
01:57:21.428 --> 01:57:24.264
Take your places.

786
01:57:34.483 --> 01:57:36.360
Ready.

787
01:57:36.443 --> 01:57:37.945
Aim.

788
01:57:38.028 --> 01:57:40.113
Fire.

789
01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:59.092
Clem, take care of the horses.

790
02:02:14.646 --> 02:02:18.191
I've been looking for you for eight months.

791
02:02:18.233 --> 02:02:22.821
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

792
02:02:22.904 --> 02:02:26.867
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

793
02:02:26.992 --> 02:02:32.832
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

794
02:02:46.762 --> 02:02:51.350
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

795
02:02:53.019 --> 02:02:56.314
Every gun makes its own tune.

796
02:02:56.355 --> 02:02:59.609
It's perfect timing, large one.

797
02:03:16.502 --> 02:03:19.129
Clem, follow him.

798
02:04:16.145 --> 02:04:19.149
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

799
02:04:19.191 --> 02:04:22.945
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

800
02:04:43.132 --> 02:04:46.719
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

801
02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:56.897
Hey...

802
02:04:56.897 --> 02:05:01.610
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

803
02:05:03.153 --> 02:05:07.574
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

804
02:05:08.074 --> 02:05:11.495
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

805
02:05:12.162 --> 02:05:16.833
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

806
02:05:18.168 --> 02:05:20.795
You... me...

807
02:05:20.921 --> 02:05:23.715
So only you know your half of the secret?

808
02:05:24.424 --> 02:05:26.009
Mm-hm.

809
02:05:27.177 --> 02:05:30.805
Ah, Blondie...

810
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:35.269
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

811
02:05:35.311 --> 02:05:38.940
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

812
02:05:39.023 --> 02:05:43.027
I forgot to mention.

813
02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:47.907
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

814
02:05:48.032 --> 02:05:51.369
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

815
02:05:53.621 --> 02:05:57.375
So that's why you came to Tuco.

816
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:02.213
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

817
02:06:13.892 --> 02:06:16.979
They shot him at close range.

818
02:06:35.581 --> 02:06:40.460
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

819
02:06:42.421 --> 02:06:46.092
They'll come looking for us.

820
02:06:46.176 --> 02:06:48.386
Watch out.

821
02:06:48.511 --> 02:06:51.514
There's two of them.

822
02:06:51.598 --> 02:06:53.808
I want that blond alive.

823
02:07:02.692 --> 02:07:06.321
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

824
02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.399
Were you going to die alone?

825
02:09:32.721 --> 02:09:33.972
Ho!

826
02:09:59.123 --> 02:10:02.210
Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.

827
02:10:02.252 --> 02:10:03.878
All right.

828
02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:48.007
"See you soon, i... idi.. "

829
02:10:48.090 --> 02:10:50.593
"Idiots. "

830
02:10:50.718 --> 02:10:53.012
It's for you.

831
02:11:17.287 --> 02:11:20.207
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

832
02:11:20.332 --> 02:11:23.960
Like a cemetery, for instance?

833
02:11:24.085 --> 02:11:27.005
There should be a bridge
across that river.

834
02:11:27.130 --> 02:11:32.719
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

835
02:11:32.761 --> 02:11:35.556
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

836
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:39.644
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

837
02:11:44.732 --> 02:11:47.735
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

838
02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.197
Come along, now. Follow me.

839
02:12:36.869 --> 02:12:40.414
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

840
02:12:53.887 --> 02:12:56.139
Where do you hail from?

841
02:12:56.181 --> 02:12:57.640
lllinois.

842
02:13:00.018 --> 02:13:01.895
And you?

843
02:13:01.978 --> 02:13:03.897
I'm with him.

844
02:13:09.819 --> 02:13:13.156
Any reason for being around here?

845
02:13:13.239 --> 02:13:16.284
We want to enlist, General.

846
02:13:18.786 --> 02:13:21.080
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

847
02:13:21.164 --> 02:13:23.250
I'm a captain.

848
02:13:24.627 --> 02:13:27.421
Get the hell out.

849
02:13:27.546 --> 02:13:30.549
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

850
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:32.635
Yes, sir.

851
02:13:37.431 --> 02:13:39.767
So you want to enlist?

852
02:13:40.684 --> 02:13:44.438
You've got to take a test to prove it.

853
02:13:52.363 --> 02:13:54.865
Well, show me.

854
02:14:12.801 --> 02:14:15.929
Hey...

855
02:14:17.722 --> 02:14:22.060
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.

856
02:14:22.185 --> 02:14:24.980
- Really?
- Sure.

857
02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:27.190
Like it says in the manual,

858
02:14:27.315 --> 02:14:32.612
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

859
02:14:32.737 --> 02:14:37.827
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war.

860
02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.249
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

861
02:14:44.417 --> 02:14:46.377
Volunteers.

862
02:14:47.962 --> 02:14:52.341
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

863
02:14:52.425 --> 02:14:55.553
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

864
02:14:57.013 --> 02:15:00.474
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

865
02:15:09.025 --> 02:15:10.443
Eh?

866
02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.119
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

867
02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:23.165
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

868
02:15:23.290 --> 02:15:29.755
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

869
02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:32.132
All of us reek of alcohol.

870
02:15:39.973 --> 02:15:42.684
What did you say your name was?

871
02:15:42.809 --> 02:15:44.019
Uh...

872
02:15:44.895 --> 02:15:47.065
And you?

873
02:15:47.815 --> 02:15:48.942
Uh...

874
02:15:49.067 --> 02:15:51.027
"Uh. " No.

875
02:15:56.032 --> 02:15:58.743
Names don't matter.

876
02:15:58.868 --> 02:16:04.374
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

877
02:16:04.499 --> 02:16:06.751
We have two attacks a day.

878
02:16:06.876 --> 02:16:09.504
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

879
02:16:09.587 --> 02:16:14.801
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

880
02:16:14.926 --> 02:16:17.929
Stupid, useless bridge.

881
02:16:18.012 --> 02:16:21.349
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

882
02:16:22.433 --> 02:16:27.815
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

883
02:16:28.858 --> 02:16:31.068
Even if all of us are killed.

884
02:16:31.193 --> 02:16:36.782
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

885
02:16:36.824 --> 02:16:41.579
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

886
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:46.917
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

887
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:53.090
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

888
02:16:53.173 --> 02:16:57.553
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

889
02:16:57.636 --> 02:17:02.893
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

890
02:17:02.893 --> 02:17:06.229
I've done a lot worse.

891
02:17:09.316 --> 02:17:13.820
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

892
02:17:13.945 --> 02:17:17.157
In here, I've destroyed it all.

893
02:17:18.116 --> 02:17:23.330
It's a court-martial offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

894
02:17:23.413 --> 02:17:29.044
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

895
02:17:30.503 --> 02:17:32.797
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

896
02:17:34.466 --> 02:17:37.803
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

897
02:17:41.265 --> 02:17:44.352
I've been dreaming about it.

898
02:17:46.854 --> 02:17:50.316
I've even worked out a plan.

899
02:17:50.441 --> 02:17:52.401
I sure have.

900
02:17:53.319 --> 02:17:56.572
The best time is after the attack,

901
02:17:56.697 --> 02:18:00.535
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

902
02:18:00.618 --> 02:18:05.623
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

903
02:18:10.628 --> 02:18:13.799
But what I lack is the guts.

904
02:18:18.971 --> 02:18:22.224
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

905
02:18:22.307 --> 02:18:25.644
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

906
02:18:25.769 --> 02:18:28.480
Be right there.

907
02:18:40.993 --> 02:18:43.161
Let's go.

908
02:18:43.161 --> 02:18:45.163
All right, friends.

909
02:18:45.247 --> 02:18:48.501
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

910
02:19:18.823 --> 02:19:21.242
Companies, report.

911
02:19:21.367 --> 02:19:24.162
Company B ready.

912
02:19:24.288 --> 02:19:27.082
Company E ready.

913
02:19:27.166 --> 02:19:30.211
Company D ready.

914
02:19:35.132 --> 02:19:38.886
Companies, forward!

915
02:19:59.823 --> 02:20:03.787
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

916
02:20:03.912 --> 02:20:05.997
Yeah.

917
02:20:58.217 --> 02:21:02.597
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

918
02:21:22.201 --> 02:21:26.580
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

919
02:21:29.917 --> 02:21:32.085
Blondie...

920
02:21:32.211 --> 02:21:34.838
The money's on the other side of the river.

921
02:21:34.922 --> 02:21:37.841
Oh? Where?

922
02:21:40.135 --> 02:21:44.097
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

923
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:48.685
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

924
02:21:48.769 --> 02:21:53.900
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

925
02:21:54.025 --> 02:22:00.031
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

926
02:22:00.073 --> 02:22:02.116
Maybe.

927
02:22:39.363 --> 02:22:43.325
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

928
02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:47.496
Hurry, a stretcher.

929
02:22:48.664 --> 02:22:51.458
Easy. Easy now.

930
02:22:55.337 --> 02:22:56.755
Arh!

931
02:23:01.343 --> 02:23:04.097
Get things ready.

932
02:23:23.867 --> 02:23:26.786
A little of this will help.

933
02:23:32.334 --> 02:23:34.836
Take a slug of this, Captain.

934
02:23:34.961 --> 02:23:36.922
And keep your ears open.

935
02:24:25.597 --> 02:24:29.351
What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

936
02:26:07.786 --> 02:26:11.873
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

937
02:26:12.374 --> 02:26:18.213
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

938
02:26:18.255 --> 02:26:20.131
Yeah, Tuco.

939
02:26:21.049 --> 02:26:23.343
Sure would be a pity.

940
02:26:53.249 --> 02:26:54.417
Doc...

941
02:26:56.711 --> 02:27:01.507
Doctor... Can you help me
live a little longer?

942
02:27:01.591 --> 02:27:04.510
I expect good news.

943
02:27:50.390 --> 02:27:53.144
Eh... Eh...

944
02:27:54.562 --> 02:27:57.607
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

945
02:27:57.732 --> 02:28:00.235
Why don't we?

946
02:28:01.236 --> 02:28:03.321
You go first.

947
02:28:05.114 --> 02:28:09.911
No, I think it's better that...

948
02:28:09.994 --> 02:28:12.413
you start.

949
02:28:15.542 --> 02:28:18.253
All right.

950
02:28:19.087 --> 02:28:23.675
The name of the cemetery is...

951
02:28:39.608 --> 02:28:41.819
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

952
02:28:50.035 --> 02:28:52.872
The name on the grave is...

953
02:28:56.292 --> 02:28:58.377
Arch Stanton.

954
02:28:58.377 --> 02:29:01.964
Ar... Arch Stanton?

955
02:29:02.047 --> 02:29:04.217
Are you sure?

956
02:29:04.342 --> 02:29:06.553
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

957
02:35:23.189 --> 02:35:26.109
Haa! Haa!

958
02:40:54.863 --> 02:40:58.409
It'll be a lot easier with that.

959
02:41:37.490 --> 02:41:39.701
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

960
02:41:40.327 --> 02:41:42.412
Dig.

961
02:41:44.415 --> 02:41:46.083
You're not digging.

962
02:41:58.596 --> 02:42:02.934
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

963
02:42:03.768 --> 02:42:05.144
Why?

964
02:42:08.064 --> 02:42:10.691
I'll tell you why.

965
02:42:10.775 --> 02:42:13.277
Cos there's nothing in there.

966
02:42:21.411 --> 02:42:24.623
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

967
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:31.630
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

968
02:42:31.713 --> 02:42:34.883
We're gonna have to earn it.

969
02:42:37.469 --> 02:42:39.763
How?

970
02:42:49.648 --> 02:42:52.568
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

971
02:42:56.322 --> 02:42:58.408
The gun?

972
02:49:04.325 --> 02:49:08.496
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

973
02:49:10.456 --> 02:49:12.750
Last night.

974
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:17.547
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

975
02:49:17.589 --> 02:49:22.260
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

976
02:49:22.385 --> 02:49:24.345
You dig.

977
02:49:24.470 --> 02:49:26.556
Where?

978
02:49:36.317 --> 02:49:38.736
Here.

979
02:49:39.653 --> 02:49:41.530
Unk... Un...

980
02:49:41.572 --> 02:49:44.491
There's no name on it.

981
02:49:44.575 --> 02:49:47.286
And there's no name here, either.

982
02:49:48.662 --> 02:49:51.582
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

983
02:49:51.665 --> 02:49:56.462
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

984
02:50:03.260 --> 02:50:05.763
Go ahead.

985
02:51:02.572 --> 02:51:06.325
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

986
02:51:22.258 --> 02:51:27.389
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

987
02:51:27.514 --> 02:51:30.851
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

988
02:51:30.934 --> 02:51:34.271
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

989
02:52:41.507 --> 02:52:45.469
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

990
02:52:50.099 --> 02:52:52.768
Four for you.

991
02:52:54.019 --> 02:52:57.189
And four...

992
02:52:58.315 --> 02:53:00.818
Four for me.

993
02:53:26.886 --> 02:53:28.221
Hey, Blon...

994
02:53:28.346 --> 02:53:29.723
Blon...

995
02:53:38.899 --> 02:53:41.192
Hey, Blondie...

996
02:53:42.402 --> 02:53:45.155
Sorry, Tuco.

997
02:53:48.159 --> 02:53:49.535
Blondie...

998
02:53:58.669 --> 02:54:01.005
Blondie!

999
02:54:08.888 --> 02:54:10.973
Blondie!

1000
02:54:20.816 --> 02:54:21.859
Blondie...

1001
02:54:32.454 --> 02:54:34.373
Blondie...

1002
02:54:49.554 --> 02:54:52.307
Blondie!

1003
02:55:13.454 --> 02:55:16.249
You son of a bitch...

1004
02:55:18.668 --> 02:55:21.087
Blondie...

1005
02:55:41.942 --> 02:55:44.320
Aaaarhh!

1006
02:56:20.273 --> 02:56:23.401
Hey, Blondie!

1007
02:56:24.236 --> 02:56:27.572
You know what you are?

1008
02:56:30.825 --> 02:56:32.702
Just a dirty son of a...

1009
02:56:33.305 --> 02:56:39.257
